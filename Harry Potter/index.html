                    <br>
                    <p>Do you like nature? Great! As you walk around our grounds
                        you will quickly learn that nature here doesn't like you!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Get up close and personal with our willow tree and discover
                        that you never truly get a day off from life threatening
                        situations around here.

                        Do you like spiders? Great! We have GIANT hairy ones that you
                        can totally chat to before experiencing the thrill of running
                        for your life.

                    <br>
                    <p>Yeah, you could go to a normal school and feel all safe... Or
                        you could come here where we will actively throw you in to
                        life threatening situations!

                        <br>
                        We will ease you in gently, where you will enjoy the delights
                        of backfiring spells exploding in your face. From there we will
                        progress you to fighting an assortment of dangerous
                        creatures. You may even get the opportunity to risk your life
                        against huge dragons for sport! Cool as, right?

                        Even some of our staff are happy to concuss you with a book

                    <br>
                    <p>If you need more, don't worry - we got you!

                        with your very own arch enemy who will stop at nothing to
                        eviscerate you!

                        <br>
                        You'll also have an amazing time learning politics as your
                        enemy takes control of the government and turns the whole
                        world against youl

                        <br>
                        Still not enough?! Well, if you hang on in there you will finally
                        get a boss battle where the stakes are legitimately high. How
                        cool is that?!
